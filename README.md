-------------------------Tic-Tac-Toe Game-------------------------

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

This is my second project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it has been developed from scratch without any pre-built templates.
